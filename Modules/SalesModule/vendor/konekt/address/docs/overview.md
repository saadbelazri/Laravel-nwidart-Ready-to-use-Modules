# Overview

This module was designed to provide with some boilerplate models and
seeds to solve common tasks needed handling address and location
information.

The models are not really intended to be used standalone (it's possible
of course) but to be used for composition.

Different apps have different approaches to organizing address data.
This module provides with some primitive models that you can utilize
within your applications structure.
