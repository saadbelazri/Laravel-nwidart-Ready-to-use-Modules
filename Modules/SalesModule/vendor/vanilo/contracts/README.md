# Vanilo Contracts

> Vanilo is an E-commerce Framework for Laravel.
Check out [vanilo.io](https://vanilo.io).

This repo defines interfaces shared across various Vanilo modules.

It also aims to support separately using modules, so that you can choose
for example to use the [checkout](https://github.com/vanilophp/checkout)
component without the [cart](https://github.com/vanilophp/cart).

Thus I can't imagine a scenario using this package alone. It comes as a
requirement of almost all Vanilo components.
